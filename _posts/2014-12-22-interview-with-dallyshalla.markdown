This week I’ve interviewed one of the first companies that decided to dedicate itself entirely to the SAFE network. I spoke with the Chief Technology Officer about their decision and plans with the network.

### What is Infinity Algorithms?

We are a software and technology firm based in San Francisco, and we are pioneering automated software development and integrating these software on the MaidSafe platform in order to harness the distributed and privately secured networking protocols offered to the public starting by David Irvine and currently the MaidSafe Team and MaidSafe Community.

### How did you learn about the SAFE network that MaidSafe is building?

I was at a Button Wood meetup in San Francisco trading some Bitcoins, and met Paige Peterson who had just started working for MaidSafe. This is the moment when I started to investigate MaidSafe and discover the genuine endeavour that is taking place over in Troon, Scotland. I just knew I wanted to be a part of this platform and spread the word.

### What does the name Infinity Algorithms stand for?

Infinity Algorithms are any code that takes a process and automates it in such a way that there is no need for a central controller. The processes are defined and their utilities and use cases occur without fail each and every time. Any task that engages physical items or leads to physical interactions can be automated such as communication platforms, agricultural cultivation, and social engagement for exchange.

### What are the goals for Infinity Algorithms?

We have planned and strategized to promote the MaidSafe platform while delivering applications that leverage decentralized algorithms that allow the people to interact without the servers and their administrators.

### Who is part of the team?

Currently, we are a California Corporation with a team of Two Engineers and four C-level executives each with an extraordinary interest for MaidSafe.

### What do you want Infinity Algorithms to be in five years?

Five years from now Our vision is that the planet's people would have adopted the MaidSafe platform and are using the technologies made for the decentralized internet which afford privacy, security, and freedom for all by default.

### Which product can we expect to be launched first and when?

We are working on what is called SAFE X (SAFE Exchange) This exchange will run on the MaidSafe platform and allow users to make items and trade them using safecoin. It is consistently being rewritten and it is expected to launch alongside the launch of the SAFE Network. Currently estimates are late February.

### Why will people use your coming exchange instead of other exchanges ?

The SAFE X affords the people the ease of being able to be totally in control of their items. Deploying this exchange is epic in nature because it will be a major break through in preventing fraud in the field of exchange. Each person can download a client and trade in open markets without giving up their assets to a custodian. The people have at their convenience the ability to transact for meaningful items knowing that the decision of their financial traversal is their own and certainly not managed or at the mercy of an unknown entity.

### What are your opinions on other cryptocurrencies and decentralising platforms like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Counterparty ?

These projects have tremendous proof of concept; however, I have investigated to conclude that they have not considered that a fundamental problem to their implementation is that platform on which they operate. Those projects do not afford their people a digital environment which secures their activities against spying. A direct example is the bitcoin public ledger: blockchain. This is great as I am doing my own accounting but I know that once I send funds to someone they can trace back every coin that ever traversed through my line. This is unacceptable and it causes woe to many in the form of targeting by thieves and extortionists. I think any project should consider first how they can fit into MaidSafe or a technology as great in scope as MaidSafe if they are to truly deploy a decentralized and also secure application for a mass of people to use.

### Why do you prefer Safecoin over Ethereum’s Ether and the blockchain’s Bitcoin?

SAFE Network's MaidSafe platform contains a cryptocurrency that has instantaneous transactions and those transactions are free. The double spend is solved also. Therefore, I know that if we are to make something we may as well ignore what is mediocre and build the best from the get go. Here we are. The Safecoin transactions are feeless, unlimited and also instantaneous. So, it would only make sense to provide people with the most secure network as the platform and the most versatile currency as a base token of value. I certainly have felt always strange working with bitcoin for example, it is slow and cumbersome, and the environment is quite amateuristic.

### Have you got some suggestions that people who are interested in the SAFE Network should check out?

Certainly the maidsafe.org forum is a place anyone should show up on. There is such a great depth of knowledge to obtain should anyone desire that knowledge and also if they would ask a question their answers will arrive by credible and thorough thinkers. Certainly any coder or aspiring computer programmer should get up to speed on their software scribing skills since this is a network that rewards accomplishment in innovation. Otherwise, getting a client and running the SAFE Network is about the most important thing anyone could do for themselves who use internet and digital environments for any important matter.
