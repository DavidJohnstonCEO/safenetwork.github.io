Today the [safenetwork.io](http://www.safenetwork.io/) team is very happy to announce the official launch of our website and platform which will provide you information, tutorials, videos, interviews and articles about the SAFE network.

Only *one month* ago we got in contact with each other to talk about the possibility of creating a platform fully dedicated to the coming SAFE network. A new and in our opinion incredibly important network, that can change lifes in your own country but also in developing countries. Our goal is to contribute to the future stories that we will tell our children;

‘Back in our days, we weren’t safe, there wasn’t a network like SAFE. We knew that everyone was watching every step we did on the internet, but we didn’t have a choice back then.’

We are a team of 5 with very different backgrounds and skills. Francis Brunelle is the founder of [SAFE Pod Montreal](http://www.safepodmtl.com/) and dedicated to evangelize about the network. Out of San Francisco comes Dally Shalla who created Spacecraft and works with Infinity Algorithms. Also from Infinity Algorithms are Jason King and Daniel Dabek. And last but not least Melvin Sol from The Netherlands, a Bitcoin (now Safecoin) and decentralized systems enthusiast.

After this introduction we can understand that you’re eager to read the first articles, so please start exploring our website and view the first videos and read the some articles.

If you would like to stay up to date about the world of SAFE you can follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/safenetwork_io), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-SAFE-Network/388183547995712) or subscribe to the newsletter (coming soon).

We are very open for contributions, feedback and tips, so please let us now what you would like to see.
