We as [safenetwork.io](http://www.safenetwork.io/) can call ourselves the ones who started the first website dedicated to the SAFE network. But the real heroes are living and creating the network itself out of Troon, Scotland.

It is the year 2006 when David Irvine decides to dedicate his life to creating the future of the Internet. He left his home country and went to a place where nobody spoke English. Without having the possibility of being disturbed by others, he started writing on what now has become the SAFE network.

> The way the Internet is designed is insane! â€“ David Irvine

When he got back out of the non-English country he started the company called MaidSafe and vested himself in Troon. With the investments of friends and family he had the possibility to hire a team to help creating his dreams. There are around 20 people who decided to help building MaidSafe, a team of very skilled people with an undefeatable ambition to create this network.

Around the spring in 2014 David Irvine and Nick Lambert (COO of Maidsafe) attended the Bitcoin New York conference to announce the SAFE Network. This presentation was the culmination of 8 years of an extreme amount of head scratching and hard work, with the MaidSafe team often working through the night, it seemed fitting to be doing it in the city that never sleeps. In addition to the announcement of the network, there was also a thing called Safecoin that attracted the Bitcoiner's attention. Maidsafe has decided to sell Safecoins in exchange for Bitcoin and Mastercoin, an historical crowdsale with receiving $6 million in five hours.

At the moment I'm writing this we're literally on the day we'll see what Testnet2 gives us and it will probably make us more demanding for the official launch
