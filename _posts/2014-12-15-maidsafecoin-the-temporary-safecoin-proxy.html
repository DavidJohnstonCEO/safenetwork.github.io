  The decentralized internet technology known as MaidSafe's comprehensive eight
  segment implementations also incorporates a cryptographically secure digital
  cash known as safecoin. This safecoin currently exists on the blockchain and
  it is in the form of maidsafecoin. These coins were initially sold by the
  MaidSafe company based in Scotland. They are early access tokens to the
  network since the safecoins are acquired through a process called farming.
</p>

<p>
  During the process of farming, farmers prove their resources to the network
  and are rewarded safecoins randomly when their computer supplies a chunk of
  meaningful data. All data that is being served by a farmer is a segment of
  a whole file, just 1MB in size, and encrypted. Naturally there will be a need
  for the first people on the SAFE Network to be able to store data so that
  afterwards someone can farm that data. As this is the case the maidsafecoins
  are proxies for the first safecoins on the network, which will allow for the
  engagement of decentralized data storage and interactivity. All access is
  encrypted and obfuscated as well as data so therefore, this Secure SAFE
  Network is the most superior space to store data for retrieval in any part
  of the planet, perhaps even the universe.

  The maidsafecoins were sold in April 27 in exchange for bitcoins and
  mastercoins. The total value in USD totalled around 5.5 million USD or
  about 10,000 bitcoins at the time. Since 452,000,000 maidsafecoins were sold
  this would mark their price at .00002212 bitcoins per maidsafecoin.
  Currently at the time of this article the price is 0.00013414 bitcoins
  per maidsafecoin 13 Dec 2014 17:22:35.
