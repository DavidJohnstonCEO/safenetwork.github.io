We as [safenetwork.io](http://www.safenetwork.io/) can call ourselves the ones who started the first website dedicated to the SAFE network. But the real heroes are living and creating the network itself out of Troon, Scotland.

It is the year 2006 when David Irvine decides to dedicate his life to creating the future of the Internet. He left his home country and went to a place where nobody spoke English. Without having the possibility of being disturbed by others, he started writing on what now has become the SAFE network.

> The way the Internet is designed is insane! – David Irvine

When he got back out of the non-English country he started the company called MaidSafe and vested himself in Troon. With the investments of friends and family he had the possibility to hire a team to help creating his dreams. There are around 20 people who decided to help building MaidSafe, a team of very skilled people with an undefeatable ambition to create this network.

Now, eight years later we are eagerly waiting for the launch and can’t wait to enter a new experience, entering the SAFE.

The entire team can be found over here: [maidsafe.net/team](http://maidsafe.net/team)
