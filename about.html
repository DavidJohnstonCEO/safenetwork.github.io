<h2>safenetwork.io</h2>

<p>
  Welcome to <strong>safenetwork.io</strong>. This website is an initiative
  started by a few benevolent and enthusiastic people who met on maidsafe.org.
  This is a website where anyone can report on the latest developments that are
  related to the SAFE Network.
  We will bring forward relevant news, events, and tutorials about the SAFE Network.
</p>

<p>
  Some of us have already heard of the SAFE Network and the MaidSafe team.
  You will find news and substantial information for using the latest applications
  in the form of reviews, and tutorials. This information you can then pass onto
  your friends, digital ones and human ones.
</p>

<p>
  Those of us who have not yet known about MaidSafe and the technology that
  this great team has deployed that is now the SAFE Network, we are here for you!
  Visit our pages, and read the texts and familiarize yourselves with getting
  into the SAFE Network. It is to you who we hope will find and make use of
  learning and entering yourselves onto the SAFE Network. The great thing about
  the SAFE Network is that it is all your choice to command your own destiny.
</p>

<p>
  Since the SAFE Network is an evolution of our 50 year old technology we know
  of as the Internet, we are so grateful to MaidSafe, the team that has made the
  Internet Safe, Secure, and Free for each person to use on the planet.
