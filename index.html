  <strong>Project SAFE</strong> (Secure Access For Everyone) aims to replace the current centralized and controlled Internet
  infrastructure into a fully decentralized and trustless network on which
  application developers can build decentralized applications.
  The network is made up by individual users who contribute storage,
  computing power and bandwidth to form a world-wide autonomous system.
  Throughout development the project's vision has been Privacy, Security and
  Freedom for all the world's population. It is believed that these goals can
  be instrumental in providing an Internet that is more inclusive and controlled
  by no individuals or companies.
