  <strong>The SAFE Network from First Principles</strong> is a series of talks
  by Erick Lavoie, that aims to introduce all the core ideas and algorithms
  behind the SAFE Network in a technical yet intuitive and accessible manner.
  The ideas presented will also allow you to better understand the upcoming wave
  of decentralized applications and be ready to effectively develop them.

The first lecture has already been crowdfunded and released. We are now in the process of crowdfunding the second lecture. The videos for Lecture 2 have been separated into 6 videos and 3 of them have been released to give you an idea of what to expect.

As part of the first and second crowd-funding campaigns for ‘The SAFE Network From First Principles’ series of lectures we used a ‘ransom’ model for obtaining funding from the community, which means that we are withholding the youtube edited version of the lectures until we reach a certain threshold of funding.

It worked really well for the first campaign but now, after more than one month, we are still ~300$US short of the 1000$US tilt amount for the second campaign. We initially decided to extend the campaign until the amount would be reached before distributing the videos. However, that delays the distribution of the videos for an indefinite amount of time.

We are now thinking of moving to a subscription-based model for the third lecture and onward, along the lines of Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/), in order to avoid having to force contributors to make an explicit and deliberate contribution on every new video released. Instead, they would commit to contribute a certain amount, up to a monthly ceiling, for every new video released.

In order to migrate to that funding model sooner, we would end the current campaign for Lecture 2, collect everyone’s money, and release the videos even though the tilt has not been reached. Since we are changing the terms of the campaign mid-course, we need the agreement of contributors for those changes to happen. You are therefore invited to vote on that change.

You can find all the videos that have been released so far in

Here is the title of the videos that will be released at the end of our crowdfunding campaign:

How are Routing Tables built?
How does a node join the SAFE Network?
How does the SAFE Network compare to BitTorrent's Mainline DHT?
You can get a privileged access to these unreleased videos as soon as the tilt (965$) is reached by supporting our crowdfunding campaign.

If you have no idea what the SAFE Network is, I suggest starting by watching

The SAFE Network will ensure the decentralized Internet is a reality by enabling:

Autonomous handling of structured and unstructured data types
Private and secure communications
Data shared at the filesystem level worldwide, no need for http, smtp, ftp etc.
Highly encrypted and private data at rest and in transit
The ability for people to self-authenticate onto the network and join anonymously
A network resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks or IP address identification
A network that requires no administrators or human intervention of any kind
No requirement for forward planning using infrastructure that automatically configures around its users in real-time (no data centres)
A highly usable and free API that enables a plethora of developers to create the next wave of secure applications not currently possible with today's centralized architecture
An underlying crypto-currency called safecoin that will incentivize all actors in this ecosystem
Of course, this project is open source (GPLv3) and you can find all the source code on GitHub.

MaidSafe is the company that has been working on the SAFE Network since 2006. They are based in Troon, Scotland. Over the last eight year, they have raised $5 million USD in funding from friends and family to hire 14 people and try to make the SAFE Network a reality. Last April, they raised $7 million USD in 5 hours during a crowdsale by pre-selling 400 million safecoins (this represents 10% of all safecoins that can ever be produced) via an intermediary coin called MaidSafeCoin. It's at that time that I first learned about the SAFE Network.

MaidSafe is encouraging developers around the world to start independent development pods (called SAFE Pods) to decentralize the knowledge and development of the underlying code. After meeting the team in Scotland in September, I decided to start SAFE Pod Montreal.
The only person helping me actively at this point is Erick Lavoie, a PhD student in Computer Science from McGill University.

The SAFE Network is not live yet. We are currently halfway through Testnet 2 (see the Project SAFE Roadmap and check out the MaidSafe JIRA activity stream for live task updates).
